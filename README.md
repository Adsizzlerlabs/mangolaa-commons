# Welcome #

This project contains domain classes as per the OpenRTB v 2.5 spec.
It contains :
   1. Json serializers and deserializers(based on Jackson library)
   2. Domain classes that utilize the Builder design pattern
   3. Utility classes for manipulating Strings, working with Java 8 Time API etc.
   
 
This is very much a work in progress
